## [0.15.0] — 2026-04-17

### Changed — Smart model downgrade for SIMPLE pipeline

- `model-routing.md` — Phase 2 reasoning now conditional: Opus for COMPLEX score, Sonnet for SIMPLE score. COMPLEX dependency graphs need deep reasoning; SIMPLE task sets (≤6 tasks) are within Sonnet capability. Keeps ViewModel gen, Pipeline C MODIFY, and D1 RCA at Opus — the phases where downgrade would materially hurt result quality.
- `complexity-classifier.md` — SIMPLE shortcuts: Phase 2 explicitly uses Sonnet for reasoning (previously implied but not stated)

Result: individual Claude Code Pro subscribers can run SIMPLE pipeline A features at ~40% lower cost with no material accuracy loss. COMPLEX features unchanged.

## [0.14.0] — 2026-04-17

### Added — Pipeline E (Micro) for trivial UI edits

- `.agent/patterns/micro-pipeline.md` (new) — 3-step pipeline for single UI element edits on existing screens: T0 plan confirm → T1 surgical edit (Haiku) → T2 quick check (5 compliance checks only); no spec, no task breakdown, no build validator, no tests, no review; escalates automatically if change requires >2 files or new logic
- `complexity-classifier.md` — TRIVIAL pre-check added as Step 0 (runs before scorer); 5 signals: single element, existing screen, no data layer, no logic change, action keyword; if all true → route to Pipeline E immediately, skip complexity scorer
- `model-routing.md` — TRIVIAL pre-check row added: all Haiku (T0 + T1 + T2)
- `gates.md` — Pipeline E gate table added (minimal: T0 user confirm + T2 quick check pass)
- `CLAUDE.md` — Step 0 TRIVIAL pre-check added to Before Every Pipeline Run; Pipeline E section added; micro-pipeline.md added to Patterns Reference

## [0.13.0] — 2026-04-17

### Added — Semi-autonomous learning system

- `.agent/patterns/learning-collector.md` (new) — Haiku agent runs after every pipeline completes; reads build/compliance/test/revision/PR reports; applies mandatory privacy filter (strips class/method names, project paths, string literals); scores HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW confidence; writes `output/<slug>/.state/learnings.md`; never blocks the pipeline
- `.agent/commands/submit-learnings.md` (new) — user-triggered command: re-verifies privacy filter; requires explicit "yes" before any git action; creates `learning/<slug>-<YYYY-MM-DD>` branch; patches `.agent/` files (Fix Catalogue rows, compliance checks); commits + pushes; opens draft PR via `gh pr create --draft`
- `CLAUDE.md` — `learning-collector.md` added to Patterns Reference; "submit learnings" added to Intent Detection and Standalone Commands tables; `[L] Learning Collector ADVISORY` step added to all 4 pipelines (A, B, C, D)
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — "Learning Submissions" section: user workflow, privacy requirements, maintainer review checklist, what not to submit

---

## [0.12.0] — 2026-04-17

### Changed — Model routing fixes, gate extraction, contributor tooling

**Model routing correctness:**
- `model-routing.md` — Complexity Classifier upgraded Haiku → Sonnet (wrong classification cascades to all downstream routing); Migration Discovery (M1) upgraded Haiku → Sonnet (UIKit behavior classification requires pattern recognition); Phase 4.5 revision diagnosis downgraded Opus → Sonnet (single-file structural diagnosis, Sonnet capable)

**Gate extraction and new gates:**
- `.agent/gates.md` (new) — complete phase gate conditions for all 4 pipelines extracted from CLAUDE.md; includes state file recovery protocol for missing/corrupted `.state/` files
- `CLAUDE.md` — Phase Gate Validators table replaced with pointer to gates.md
- `m01-discovery.md` — M1→M2 Quality Gate checklist added (every component named in change request must have discovery entry; tech debt baseline saved)
- `gates.md` + `CLAUDE.md` — M1→M2 gate formally added to Pipeline B

**Compliance checker robustness:**
- `compliance-checker.md` — C-2 force-unwrap grep rewritten: `[a-zA-Z0-9_)]!` prevents false positives from boolean-NOT `!isEnabled`
- `compliance-checker.md` — C-10 #Preview grep rewritten: uses `IFS= read -r` loop (no word splitting on spaces) and `struct [A-Za-z]*: View` pattern (no false matches on protocol conformances)

**Complexity classifier soft window:**
- `complexity-classifier.md` — Added scoring uncertainty note: ±8 pt variance; scores 35–45 default to COMPLEX; only ≤30 is reliably SIMPLE

**Contributor tooling:**
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` (new) — how to add patterns, pipeline phases, pipelines, and rules without breaking existing behavior; format rules for pattern files
- `.agent/RULE-INDEX.md` (new) — cross-reference mapping each hard rule to every file that enforces or references it
- `self-validation.md` — Testing framework check made conditional: Xcode 15 → `XCTestCase`, Xcode 16+ → `@Suite` + `@Test`

**Maintenance:**
- `03-code-gen.md` — Inline self-check list replaced with single reference to `self-validation.md` (eliminates dual-maintenance risk)
- All 15+ pattern files — "Apply when" preambles removed (~678 static tokens saved; ~2–4K per complex pipeline run)
- `CLAUDE.md` — Hard Rules section moved to top of file (first ~25 lines, before pipelines)

---

## [0.11.0] — 2026-04-16

### Added — Gap 3, 4, 5 Optimizations

**Gap 3 — Pipeline B (Migration) strengthened:**
- `m05-parity-checker.md` — switched from Swift Testing to XCTest (Xcode 15+), added `@MainActor` rule, added Phase Completion step: run `xcodebuild test` after parity test generation; BLOCKED verdict mandatory if any test fails
- `CLAUDE.md` — added `[M4.5] Build Validator` and `[M5.1] Test Run` to Pipeline B; added explicit gates M2→M3, M4→M4.5, M4.5→M5, M5.1→merge to Phase Gate Validators table

**Gap 4 — LLM non-determinism controlled:**
- `compliance-checker.md` (new) — 11 grep-based Hard Rule checks; no LLM judgment; deterministic pass/fail per check; violations = [BLOCKER]; runs after Phase 3 before build; writes `compliance-report.md`; checks: no print(), no force unwrap, no hardcoded Color/font, NavigationStack only in root, no ObservableObject, no URLSession in ViewModel, no token in UserDefaults, no unresolved TODO, every View has #Preview, no raw error.localizedDescription
- `CLAUDE.md` — Phase 3→3.5 gate updated: compliance-checker must pass; compliance-checker added to Patterns Reference

**Gap 5 — Context management strengthened:**
- `context-management.md` — added Large Feature Protocol (>8 tasks): wave manifest, per-wave context loading, wave checkpoint writing; added Token Budget Reference table (lines per file type, files per pass); added Context Pressure Signals section with early-save triggers

---

## [0.10.0] — 2026-04-16

### Fixed — Gaps found during real compile test
- `04-unit-test.md` — Default framework changed to XCTest (Xcode 15+); Swift Testing (`import Testing`) documented as Xcode 16+ only; added `@MainActor` rule for test class when ViewModel is `@MainActor @Observable`; added "Phase Completion" section: run `xcodebuild test` after generation, diagnose failures, one fix round, write `04-test-report.md`
- `06-build-validator.md` — Added 2 patterns to Fix Catalogue: `@MainActor`-isolated property access in non-`@MainActor` View; `ShapeStyle has no member 'appX'` due to missing `extension ShapeStyle where Self == Color`
- `component-library.md` — Added "Theme Token Integration" section explaining why both `extension Color` and `extension ShapeStyle where Self == Color` are required for shorthand color syntax
- `CLAUDE.md` — Added Phase 4.1 (Test Run) to Pipeline A; split Phase 4→4.5 gate into 4→4.1 and 4.1→4.5 with test pass requirement; updated Target Stack to Swift 5.9+ / Xcode 15+

### Changed
